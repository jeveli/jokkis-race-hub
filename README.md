# Jokkis Race Hub

The **Jokkis Race Hub** is a web-based application built using Python and Streamlit to scrape race data from the *jokkis.net* website. The application allows users to search for drivers, races, and race results from various competitions available on the site. You can filter results based on driver name or club, view ongoing races, and refresh results automatically at set intervals.

## Features

- **Driver and Club Search**: Enter a driver or club name to find specific race results.
- **Race Results Filtering**: Filter races to show only those that are unfinished.
- **Automatic Refresh**: Option to automatically refresh race results every few seconds.
- **Clear Results**: Easily clear the displayed results and start a new search.
- **Multilingual Support**: Supports Swedish and Finnish languages.
  
## Instructions

### How to Use

1. **Language Selection**: 
   - In the sidebar, select your preferred language (Swedish or Finnish).
   
2. **Search for a Driver or Club**:
   - Enter the driver or club name in the search field to filter results.
   - The search will match the full name or parts of the name, but only return exact word matches (e.g., searching for "Naski" will return "Jerry Naski" but not names like "Koivisto").

3. **Filtering for Unfinished Races**:
   - You can filter races to show only those that are still ongoing by checking the **"Visa endast oavslutade lopp"** option.

4. **Automatic Updates**:
   - You can enable automatic updates for the race results by selecting the **"Aktivera automatisk uppdatering"** option and adjusting the update interval.

5. **Clear Results**:
   - Clear the results from the screen using the **"Rensa allt"** button to start a new search.
